summary: A complete redesign of UH Manoa's campus center website that my team developed in ICS 465.
---

CC Revamp is a website redesign of the current [UHM campus center website](https://www.hawaii.edu/campuscenter/) that I helped create as a team project in ICS 465, Spring 2018. We orginally had the idea to completely redesign the website because the offical university website has become outdated and does scale well to modern devices. By utilizing some modern web frameworks, we could help to modernize the website and make it a website that is easy to navigate for all.

CC Revamp is implemented using [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for front-end interface and [Express.js]
(https://expressjs.com/) for the server-side backend. Since the campus center website acts as a main hub that connects to many other webpages, we implemented an effective search bar using [Tipue Search](https://tipue.com/search/). Along with these technologies, we also utilized [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to simplify our codebase when it came to redirecting to other webpages.
