Flagship Hackathon is an national event in partnership with the National Language Flagship and hosted by the Flagship technology center at UH Manoa where students from all the avalaible Flagship Universities are to selected to come and work together to innovate on technologies that will help students in their studies for learning foreign languages. The app my team developed is called Wordworm which is a web app that will help to solve the issue that many students face when learning a foreign language: a lack of authentic materials especially at the higher levels if students want to focus their language learning on a specific field. 

For this project, I was in charge of the more technical aspects of the prototyping such what technologies we would use to implement our web app. I also worked with one other team member to do a final presentation about our project to the entire National Flagship cohort online.  First, we defined our problems and scope. Through this, our team decided on what features we wanted and I would be in charge of deciding the feasibility of these features. Then, I had to decide on the potential implementation issues that we could run into and then identified the different technologies (frameworks/algorithms) to use such as frontend/backend frameworks and NLP algorithms.
